# Policy & Risk Assessment Tool

This project is aimed to allow for organisations and IT employees who lack intensive resources and experience respetcively to be able to perform a Policy & Risk Assessment digitally. Whilst the main focus for this tool to be used by SMEs (small medium-sized enterprises) using cloud computing environments, it can be utilised across an organisation for different departments, sub teams and projects. Integrating AI into API requests will allow a user to go through all the steps of a risk assessment, and allow employees (users) and managers/IT department (superusers) to work together to build an automated policy.

#   3. A **JWT (JSON Web Token) secret key** is used to sign and verify tokens for authentication and security.
    
GENERATE A SECURE JWT SECREY KEY:

Choose one of the following methods:

**Method 1: Using Node.js**
Run the following command in your terminal:

node -e console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))

This will generate a random 64-byte secrey key
```

**Method 2: Usinf OpenSSL**

 #  4. Generating your own OpenAI API key (Credits required)

CREATE OPENAI ACCOUNT

1. **Go to OpenAI's website**:  
[https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)  
2. Click **"Sign Up"** and create an account using **email/GitHub/Google/Microsoft**.  
3. **Verify your email** and log in.  
4. **Complete phone number verification** (required for security).  

ADD CREDITS/API TOKENS

**Note:** If you're a new user, OpenAI may provide **$6 in free credits** automatically, which can be used without adding a payment method. Check your **Usage Dashboard**:  
[https://platform.openai.com/account/usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)  


GENERATE YOUR API KEY

1. **Go to API Key Management**:  
[https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)  
2. Click **"Create API Key"**.  
3. Copy the generated key **immediately**, as OpenAI wonâ€™t show it again.  
4. **Store it securely** in a `.env` file (see next step).  


#   5. Create your own private .env file in the 'backend' directory:
```sh
'cd repo_name'
'cd backend'
'touch .env' (in your terminal)
```

1. Set the following API keys and links as follows:
    - PORT=8000 (ensure the port is not in use elsewhere)
    - MONGO_URI= 'your_mongo_uri_here' (created frmo MongoDB Atlas)
    - JWT_SECRET = 'your_jwt_secret_key_here'
    - OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key_here'
